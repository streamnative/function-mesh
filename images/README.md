# Function Mesh Runner Images

Function Mesh uses runner images as functions / connectors' Pod images. Each runtime runner image only contains necessary tool-chains and libraries for specified runtime.

## Images
### Base Runner
The base Runner is located at `./pulsar-functions-base-runner`. The base runner contains basic tool-chains like `/pulsar/bin`, `/pulsar/conf` and `/pulsar/lib` to ensure that the `pulsar-admin` CLI tool works properly to support [Apache Pulsar Packages](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/admin-api-packages/).

### Java Runner
[![Docker Image Version (tag latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/streamnative/pulsar-functions-java-runner/2.7.1?style=for-the-badge)](https://hub.docker.com/r/streamnative/pulsar-functions-java-runner)

The Java Runner is based on Base Runner and contains the Java function instance to run Java functions or connectors.

The `streamnative/pulsar-functions-java-runner` Java runner is stored at the Docker Hub and is automatically updated to align with Apache Pulsar release.

### Python Runner
[![Docker Image Version (tag latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/streamnative/pulsar-functions-python-runner/2.7.1?style=for-the-badge)](https://hub.docker.com/r/streamnative/pulsar-functions-python-runner)

The Python runner is based on the base runner and contains the Python function instance to run Python functions. You can build your own Python runner to customize Python dependencies.

The `streamnative/pulsar-functions-python-runner` Python runner is located at the Docker Hub and is automatically updated to align with Apache Pulsar release.

### Golang Runner
[![Docker Image Version (tag latest semver)](https://img.shields.io/docker/v/streamnative/pulsar-functions-go-runner/2.7.1?style=for-the-badge)](https://hub.docker.com/r/streamnative/pulsar-functions-go-runner)

The Golang runner provides all the toolchain and dependencies required to run Golang functions.

The `streamnative/pulsar-functions-go-runner` Golang runner is located at the Docker Hub and is automatically updated to align with Apache Pulsar release.

## How to use

### Use with [Apache Pulsar Packages](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/admin-api-packages/)
#### Prerequisite

- Apache Pulsar 2.8.0
- Function Mesh v0.1.3 

#### Package your function locally
You can package Pulsar Functions in Java, Python and Go. Please refer to the [official document](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/functions-package/) to packaging your Pulsar Functions.

#### Upload your function to Pulsar Cluster
With the packaged functions, user can upload the function package into [Apache Pulsar Packages](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/admin-api-packages/).

You can upload a package to the package management service by `pulsar-admin`:

```bash
bin/pulsar-admin packages upload function://my-tenant/my-ns/my-function@0.1 --path package-file --description package-description
```

Then user can define Function Mesh CRDs to use the uploaded function package.

#### Submit to Function Mesh

Below is a sample CRD to create a Java function from package `function://my-tenant/my-ns/my-function@0.1`.
```yaml
apiVersion: compute.functionmesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: java-function-sample
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: streamnative/pulsar-functions-java-runner:2.7.1 # using java function runner
  className: org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.examples.ExclamationFunction
  forwardSourceMessageProperty: true
  MaxPendingAsyncRequests: 1000
  replicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  logTopic: persistent://public/default/logging-function-logs
  input:
    topics:
    - persistent://public/default/java-function-input-topic
    typeClassName: java.lang.String
  output:
    topic: persistent://public/default/java-function-output-topic
    typeClassName: java.lang.String
  pulsar:
    pulsarConfig: "test-pulsar"
  java:
    jar: my-function.jar # the package will download as this filename.
    jarLocation: function://my-tenant/my-ns/my-function@0.1 # function package URL
```

If you are not using self built runner image, you can skip `image`, Function Mesh manager will choose image according to the runtime defined in CRD. (for example, if user define `java` runtime settings, Function Mesh will use `streamnative/pulsar-functions-java-runner` by default)

### Use with self-built Docker image

#### Prerequisite

- Apache Pulsar 2.7.0
- Function Mesh v0.1.3 

#### Package your function locally
You can package Pulsar Functions in Java, Python and Go. Please refer to the [official document](http://pulsar.apache.org/docs/en/next/functions-package/) to packaging your Pulsar Functions.

#### Build your function image
You can write up a `Dockerfile` to build your function image packed with your function executable and all dependencies.
For example, with a packed Java function called `example-function.jar`, you can define a `Dockerfile` as below.

```dockerfile
# Use pulsar-functions-java-runner since we pack Java function
FROM streamnative/pulsar-functions-java-runner:2.7.1
# Copy function JAR package into /pulsar directory  
COPY example-function.jar /pulsar/
```

With the `Dockerfile`, you can build the function image and push into image registry (like Docker Hub, or any private registry)

#### Submit to Function Mesh

Assume we build the image from previous step as `streamnative/example-function-image:latest`, and pushed into Docker Hub already.

Below is a sample CRD to create a Java function from docker image.
```yaml
apiVersion: compute.functionmesh.io/v1alpha1
kind: Function
metadata:
  name: java-function-sample
  namespace: default
spec:
  image: streamnative/example-function-image:latest # using function image here
  className: org.apache.pulsar.functions.api.examples.ExclamationFunction
  forwardSourceMessageProperty: true
  MaxPendingAsyncRequests: 1000
  replicas: 1
  maxReplicas: 5
  logTopic: persistent://public/default/logging-function-logs
  input:
    topics:
    - persistent://public/default/java-function-input-topic
    typeClassName: java.lang.String
  output:
    topic: persistent://public/default/java-function-output-topic
    typeClassName: java.lang.String
  pulsar:
    pulsarConfig: "test-pulsar"
  java:
    jar: /pulsar/example-function.jar # the package location in image
    jarLocation: "" # leave empty since we will not download package from Pulsar Packages
```

When you use Function Mesh with self build images, you need to define the executable location within CRD yaml file, below are the settings for different function runtime.

```yaml
  java: # Java runtime
    jar: example-function.jar
  python: # Python runtime
    py: exclamation_function.py
  golang: # Golang runtime
    go: go_func_executable
```

## Scripts

`build.sh` is a bash script used to build base, Java, Python, and Golang runner locally.
